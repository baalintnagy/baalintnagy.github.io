## ABOUT ME

From about the age of 15, I have been deeply passionate about software development and computational problem-solving. This early start laid the foundation for what would lead to gaining a Master's degree in Software Engineering and a career in the realm of IT.

My specialization leans heavily towards backend development, with a particular emphasis on Java — having witnessed the evolution of JDK from 1.4 to 21. My expertise consists of technologies like Spring and Spring Boot, microservices architecture, ORM: JPA/Hibernate, and a variety of RDBMS databases such as MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL and Oracle, alongside NoSQL solutions like Elasticsearch, MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra.

Additionally, I'm experienced in message streaming solutions like Apache Kafka, and fluent in utilizing tools like Git, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, as well as Docker/Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.

While my proficiency is predominantly in backend development, I am always willing and capable of learning and adapting to new technologies
